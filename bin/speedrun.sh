# Train a tiny nanochat checkpoint for Ruby nanochat
#
# This is a simplified version adapted for CPU/single-GPU training.
# For the full $100 8Ã—H100 training, use python-nanochat directly.
#
# This script trains a d4 model (4 layers, ~30 mins on CPU)
# The Python nanochat speedrun.sh trains a d20 model (~4 hours on 8Ã—H100)
